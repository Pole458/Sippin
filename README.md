# Sippin

Sippin is an open source library based on [mjSip](http://www.mjsip.org/) for making VoIP calls on Android leveraging on the SIP protocol.

This library only supports audio calls. In particular, the following audio codec are supported:

- L16
- PCMU
- PCMA
- AMR
- GSM
- GSM-EFR

The first are directly implemented in the library, while the others are already included in the Android API.
